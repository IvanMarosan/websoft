<h1>My report page in the course websoft</h1>

<p><img src="img/me.jpg" width="500" alt="Me on an image"></p>

<p>This is my report-page in the course. This page contains a presentation of myself. Keep this site updated all through the course and hand it in, for grading, in the end of the course.</p>

<p>So, a presentation might be in order.</p>

<p>My name is Ivan Marosan. I was born in a little town known as Hofors in Gästrikland, Sweden. When I was about 7~8 years old my parents moved down from Hofors to Eslöv before finally settling down in Lund. I've lived in Lund for all my time since then.</p>

<p>I'm currently a student on Högskolan Kristianstad pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Prior to that I used to study the teacher's program before dropping out from it since I didn't find the job appealing after 3 years of study. When I'm not studying one can find me working in an orthopedical clinic to make some extra money</p>

<p>My hobbies are what one would say your typical nerd hobbies. I like video games, and traditional games like card games and board games. One of my favourite games is Magic the Gathering where I do play on a semi-competitive level.</p>

<p>Besides that I'm always up to help people and I do try my best to stay in touch with people.</p>
