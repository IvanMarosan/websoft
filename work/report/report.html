<h2>S01</h2>
<h3>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</h3>
<p>Personally, I've utilized Git through an application called GitHub Desktop and the inbuilt features of IntelliJ IDE.
The main advantage of this is that I never really had the to learn to utilize Git via a terminal since the UI does it for one.
Other than that my knowledge prior to this introduction were limited. I've hear about it but never really utilized these functions</p>

<h3>Have you ever created websites before?</h3>
<p>No, I've never created a webpages beyond utilizing Tomcat for some RESTful web applications that involves accessing some sort of data.</p>

<h3>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</h3>
<p>I've never had much experience with web applications beyond some features that Tomcat had for some laborations.</p>

<h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
<p>TIL: The basics of utilizing Git through terminal and it's features.</p>

    <h3>Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>I haven't utilized HTML, CSS or JavaScript prior to this course so my knowledge about how to use them is slim.
        The only exposure I have had about them is flipping through some webpages and textbooks</p>

    <h3>Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.</h3>
        <p>The roles for the various elements are the following:
            CSS is primarily used to for style.
            You use this to make your webpage stylized and prettier.
            HTML is quite simple.
            It's what makes your website readable for humans.
            JavaScript is what makes your website dynamic.
            It's the coding part of designing a website.</p>

        <h3>Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.</h3>
        <p>How the browser, HTTP and web services interact is quite simple.
            First and foremost a web service is the very heart of communication between two machines.
            It allows one to communicate with each other utilizing an agreed upon protocol.
            This is where HTTP comes into places since HTTP is the most common utilized protocol for such communication.
            HTTP is a request/response style protocol where the client sends a request and gets back a response.
            In this one's web browser is the client and it's purpose is to send a request and get back a response that it can display for the user.
            </p>

    <h3>Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript?</h3>
    <p>Programming with client side JavaScript I have next to no experience in prior to this course. So this was new stuff for me.
    Overall I did enjoy this assignment since it was something new.</p>

    <h3>Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?</h3>
    <p>Comparing to the languages I know which is Java and Android's Java, there are some similarities between them.
            For instance is that all of these languages are object-oriented.I.E they deal with the concepts of objects.
            However there are some difference that do stick them apart. One of these difference that's noticeable is that
            JavaScript is a much more dynamic language compare to Java. As type checking is done during run time rather
            than compile time. So when comparing them in my view it's like comparing night and day.</p>

        <h3>Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?</h3>
        <p>The grade I aimed for was a grade 4. How my code turned out to be was a bit narrowed minded to be honest.
            For one part I was stuck at displaying the schools properly so I had to search the web for some help.
            But beside some overbloating in the css style where I chucked the flags in, I'd say it turned out pretty well.
        One thing that was interesting to learn was that one can write JavaScript and CSS elements in HTML just fine. Even
        if it's not best practice and makes the file overall cluttered</p>

<h2>S04</h2>
    <h3>Tell me about your previous experience on node/npm or any equal programming tools.</h3>
    <p>I've had no previous experience with node/npm previously. I've had however experience with Tomcat as a RESTful service.
    Overall it was fun to try out.</p>

    <h3>How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?</h3>
    <p>I enjoyed working with JavaScript, Node and Express. It was refreshing to see how it all was intertwined with each other.</p>

    <h3>Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?</h3>
    <p>For this coding assignment I decided to first do the pre-requs for it. Studied them up to see how everything worked out.
    Any major plans I did not really have. I did the pre-requs and the they were for the most part a
        good stepping stone to learn how to utilize node.js and npm. </p>

    <h3>What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?</h3>
    <p>For the moment I aimed for a grade 3. And it wasn't difficult at all. I might before the course end try to see if I can improve on the grade .
    However one thing that was kinda of a bother was the provided example code for the die roll. Since lotto behaves somewhat similar I used it, however
    using the code to check for duplicates did not work as intended. However running it without making it an object it worked just fine.</p>

<h2>S05</h2>
<h3>How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?</h3>
    <p>I feel like PHP is a pretty okay language once you get the hang of it. It was a bit troublesome at the start but with
    example code and some short studying it's quite easy to get a hang of it. One thing that kinda bothered me with PHP was
    that each variable had to have a $ a the start. This kinda made the code look more cluttered than it actually was for the
    untrained eye. Another thing that bothered me was that if one has an if statement it has to end with and endif. This was the same
        for foreach, it had to end with a endforeach. This felt a bit unorthodox compare to modern programming language.
        One thing that helped with de-cluttering the code was separating the files from each other with the view folder.</p>
    <h3>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</h3>
    <p>Comparing PHP to the languages I know there are some similarities. Especially JavaScript when it comes to
    how they handle variables. Another thing I've noticed with PHP is that it's this weird mix of code and HTML. For instance
     when one made the header and the footer it was PHP, however I could freely write HTML outside of the PHP scope without any hassle
    at all.</p>
    <h3>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</h3>
    <p>The grade I aimed for this assigment was grade 4. Reasoning for this was that the examples provided were helpful and
    and once you got the hang of PHP and database it wasn't that hard of a grade to aim for.</p>
    <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
    <p>TIL: What I've learned today was how PHP works and integrating a database with a website.</p>

<h2>S06</h2>
    <h3>What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programming languages?</h3>
<p>What makes a programming language popular is dependant on the technologies that utilizes that specific language. For instance
Java is a very popular language when it comes backend development of server applications because thanks to the JVM you can run it anywhere.
However when it comes to for instance game development Java is not as popular due to the (hardware) technologies behind games predates Virtual Machines,
    so most developers don't utilize it since you couldn't re-use code. In fact the most popular engines for 3D games are almost exclusively
C/C++ based. So the popularity of a language is all dependence on the technologies that wants to utilize it.</p>
    <h3>What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?</h3>
    <p>My choice of language is dependent entirely on what I'm going to work with. For instance if I'm planning to become a web developer on the front-end, naturally, I would
    pick JavaScript. Because it is one of the most utilized language. When it comes for Android development my choices are limited to only Java
    and Kotlin. If I want to work on game development I'd have to pretty much stick with C/C++ since most engines are based off that.
    So picking an individual language to work with is a bit difficult but if I'd personally have to pick one language I'd want to
    work with then it would be Java.</p>
    <h3>Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.</h3>
    <p>For this I decided to check the popularity of two statically typed languages in this case Java and C++, and two dynamically typed language
    which in this case are JavaScript and Python. The graph itself shows one interesting thing that I did not really anticipate.</p>
    <img src="img/trend.png" height="570" width="1000">
    <p>This was the fact that Java over hte five past years have been on a steady decline in popularity. Going from nearly 100
    to a meager 60 in over in less than 4 years. Another thing that was interesting to see was how popular Python as a language has become.
    Going from being searched as often as C++ into eclipsing both Java and JavaScript in just a few years. Why this is like this is difficult
    to pinpoint. However my assumption is going to be that Java is losing popularity is due to its age. While Python is relatively new comparing to the
    other languages.</p>
    <h3>If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?</h3>
    <p>Recommending a new language or framework to a large project is quite difficult. Since it all depends on the knowledge of said
    language or framework, as well if the manager wants to approve it. If I would however sell a language I would try to highlight
    its strength and elaborate on it how it will overcome the language's weakness.</p>
    <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
    <p>TIL: The overall change in popularity among programming language. It was interesting to see how Java has declined while Python has increased</p>

    <h3>Try to explain the platform .NET (C#, ASP.NET) to a skilled programmer, but newbie to this Microsoft technology.</h3>
<p>.NET Core is a framework that's meant for server applications written in primarily C# and F#. One advantage that .NET Core has is that
it's developed and maintained by Microsoft Inc. This means that it has large amount of support and help for both experienced and new
developers out there</p>
    <h3>Elaborate by comparing .NET technologies with the other technologies we learned during the course.</h3>
    <p>When I compare .NET to the other technologies we've studied it felt like it was the more robust of them all. For instance
    when compared to PHP it felt more like a natural development environment akin to Java. However, despite it being more robust
    it felt like it was a much harder assigment to understand unlike the PHP assigment or client-side JavaScript. One example of this
    that I'm still a bit unsure about is that one has to save files as .cshtml that then utilize .cs files with the name and file extension of the .cshtml file.
    If I studied the underlying technologies I would probably understand more on why it is this way.</p>
    <h3>Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?</h3>
    <p>For this exercise I aimed for a grade 3, and overall I'm satisfied with the results. This assignment was one of the more harder
    assignments to understand compare to something like client-side JavaScript. There were a lot of intricate details when it came to the webapp
    part of the assignment that made it a bit more difficult to understand fully. As mentioned previously it was difficult to understand
        why a .cshtml file requires a .cs file to function instead of having it all in the same file. However, despite this there were
    some of it that I enjoyed. Such as structuring files to their corresponding uses. This made it a lot more cleaner to find and read
    on what their overall function is. When it came to the console application it felt pretty similar to Java in many ways when it came
        to actual coding. There were naturally some differences here and there but I was a bit shocked on how similar things were.</p>

    <h3>Websites</h3>
<p>When out group decided the three websites we decided to select a diverse set of websites to compare and analyze. This is
because comparing three websites that serves the same purpose is a bit counter-intuitive since there will always then be then a
<b>best</b> website. Instead we took websites with different purposes to see how they compete against each other. The websites that were chosen
are the following:</p>
    <div>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Website</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Thebestwebsiteintheinternet</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Stackoverflow</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Scryfall</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <p>The reasoning why these three are quite simple. The first website <i>"thebestwebsiteintheinternet"</i> is a website that shows bad practice.
        We took this one because on what to not do. The second website <i>"Stackoverflow"</i> is a popular websites for developers all over the world,
    So this website naturally gets a lot of traffic and thus it has to keep up with this. The third and last website <i>"Scryfall"</i> was chosen
    because it claims to be a powerful Magic the Gathering card search tool. Thus we wanted to see if it's really all that powerful</p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>The results are here.</p>
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTNdy_cWwsDxgQVOz6_XTN7hmIRgqdWCIPuaUgp7D0dnro3xAyjdktpgHBnziYLNA_IwZ6Tjvs55k69/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false" height="1000" width="800" align="left"></iframe>
   <h3>Summery</h3>
    <p>As we can see from the table sheet some websites performs better than others. As we can see in <i>thebestwebsiteintheinternet</i>, it's quite
    inefficient as far as loading components, in fact it has an MP3 file in the background takes 6 seconds to load, and that many components gets 403 errors.
    <i>Stackoverflow</i> is quite the efficient website when it comes to loading components, in fact a lot of the improvements just shaves off a few miliseconds.
    The last website <i>Scryfall</i> is quite the efficient for what it's purpose is and that is to show images. In fact the website utilize
    Some efficient methods such as only loading images when a user scrolls down instead of trying to load them all at once.</p>
    <h3>What is your TIL for this course section?</h3>
    <p>It was surprising to learn how certain websites do to improve performance. Compare to the bad ones.</p>
