<h2>S01</h2>
<h3>Question 1)</h3>
<p>Personally, "I've utilized Git through an application called GitHub Desktop and the inbuilt features of IntelliJ IDE.
The main advantage of this is that I never really had the to learn to utilize Git via a terminal since the UI does it for one.
Other than that my knowledge prior to this introduction were limited. I've hear about it but never really utilized these functions"</p>

<h3>Question 2)</h3>
<p>"No, I've never created a webpages beyond utilizing Tomcat for some RESTful web applications that involves accessing some sort of data."</p>

<h3>Question 3)</h3>
<p>"I've never had much experience with web applications beyond some features that Tomcat had for some laborations."</p>

<h3>Question 4)</h3>
<p>"TIL: The basics of utilizing Git through terminal and it's features."</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
    <h3>Question 1)</h3>
    <p>"I haven't utilized HTML, CSS or JavaScript prior to this course so my knowledge about how to use them is slim.
        The only exposure I have had about them is flipping through some webpages and textbooks"</p>

    <h3>Question 2)</h3>
        <p>"The roles for the various elements are the following:
            CSS is primarily used to for style.
            You use this to make your webpage stylized and prettier.
            HTML is quite simple.
            It's what makes your website readable for humans.
            JavaScript is what makes your website dynamic.
            It's the coding part of designing a website."</p>

        <h3>Question 3)</h3>
        <p>"How the browser, HTTP and web services interact is quite simple.
            First and foremost a web service is the very heart of communication between two machines.
            It allows one to communicate with each other utilizing an agreed upon protocol.
            This is where HTTP comes into places since HTTP is the most common utilized protocol for such communication.
            HTTP is a request/response style protocol where the client sends a request and gets back a response.
            In this one's web browser is the client and it's purpose is to send a request and get back a response that it can display for the user.
            "</p>

        <h3>Question 4)</h3>
        <p>"TIL: The basics of utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript."</p>

<h2>S03</h2>
    <h3>Question 1)</h3>
    <p>"Programming with client side JavaScript I have next to no experience in prior to this course."</p>

    <h3>Question 2)</h3>
    <p>"Comparing to the languages I know which is Java and Android's Java, there are some similarities between them.
            For instance is that all of these languages are object-oriented.I.E they deal with the concepts of objects.
            However there are some difference that do stick them apart. One of these difference that's noticeable is that
            JavaScript is a much more dynamic language compare to Java. As type checking is done during run time rather
            than compile time. So when comparing them in my view it's like comparing night and day."</p>

        <h3>Question 3)</h3>
        <p>"The grade I aimed for was a grade 4. How my code turned out to be was a bit narrowed minded to be honest.
            For one part I was stuck at displaying the schools properly so I had to search the web for some help.
            But beside some overbloating in the css style where I chucked the flags in, I'd say it's okay."</p>

        <h3>Question 4)</h3>
        <p>"TIL: The basics of utilizing HTML, CSS and JavaScript."</p>

    <p>"I've had no previous experience with node/npm previously. I've had however experience with Tomcat as a RESTful service"</p>

    <h3>Question 2</h3>
    <p>"I enjoyed working with JavaScript, Node and Express. It was refreshing to see how it all was intertwined with each other."</p>

    <h3>Question 3</h3>
    <p>"For this coding assignment I decided to first do the pre-requs for it. Studied them up to see how everything worked out.
    Any major plans I did not really have. I did the pre-requs and the they were for the most part a
        good stepping stone to learn how to utilize node.js and npm. "</p>

    <h3>Question 4</h3>
    <p>"For the moment I aimed for a grade 3. And it wasn't difficult at all. I might before the course end try to see if I can improve on the grade."</p>
